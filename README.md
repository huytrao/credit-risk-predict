# Home Credit Default Risk Project

## Project Introduction

This is a complete machine learning project for the Kaggle Home Credit Default Risk competition. Many people find it difficult to obtain loans due to a lack of or no credit history, and these populations are often exploited by untrustworthy lenders.

Home Credit Group is committed to expanding financial inclusion for unbanked populations by providing a positive and safe lending experience. To ensure these underserved populations have a positive lending experience, Home Credit uses various alternative data (including telecommunications and transaction information) to predict customers' repayment ability.

## Project Goal

Predict each applicant's ability to repay the loan, using AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) as the evaluation metric.

## Dataset Description

1.  **application_train.csv / application_test.csv**: Main table, containing static data for all applications
2.  **bureau.csv**: Historical credit records of clients from other financial institutions
3.  **bureau_balance.csv**: Monthly balance of historical credits from the credit bureau
4.  **POS_CASH_balance.csv**: Monthly balance snapshots of POS and cash loans
5.  **credit_card_balance.csv**: Monthly balance snapshots of credit cards
6.  **previous_application.csv**: Historical application records of clients at Home Credit
7.  **installments_payments.csv**: Repayment records for historical credits
